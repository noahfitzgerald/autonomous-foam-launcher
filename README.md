# Autonomous Thermal-Targeting Foam Launcher

This repository is a fork of a Cal Poly ME 405 team project completed by Noah Fitzgerald, Kevin Jung, and Aidan Schwing.

The project was a fixed-position, single-axis foam-ball launcher designed for a duel-style competition. The robot began facing backward, rotated 180 degrees, targeted an opponent using a thermal camera, and fired NERF Rival balls using a custom shooting mechanism.

## Introduction
The code and CAD files present in this repository serve as reference for a fixed position, single-axis mechanism intended to shoot NERF RIVAL balls of approximately 1" diameter. This robot participated in a duel-style competition where two teams with similarly designed mechanisms competed to shoot the opposing team as quickly as possible. Robots were required to begin facing backwards, rotate 180 degrees, target with a thermal camera, and shoot the opponent.

Our team designed a custom shooting mechanism and implemented a stepper motor as our rotating axis. The specific implementation was intended for use by students in Cal Poly's ME 405 course, though use in the future is not limited to those individuals. Files are provided under the MIT License.  

While the documentation provided here may provide a good baseline, it is *not* comprehensive and *is not* intended to provide step-by-step instructions for recreation. 


## Hardware Overview
Much of the mechanical design was based on COTS hardware and components available on-hand. Shooting is performed with a [BLDC motor](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/propdrive-v2-2836-1800kv-brushless-outrunner-motor.html?wrh_pdp=3) driven by an [ESC](https://www.rcelectricparts.com/40a-esc---classic-series.html) and was sized to shoot at approximately the same speed as a stock NERF rifle. Balls are pushed into the wheels with a MG90s servo.

## Firmware Design

The firmware for the project was split across two microcontrollers. One handled only stepper motor control via a real-time planning method and received commands from the main controller over I2C. The other contained the main control loop and aiming algorithm, as well as control for PWM based devices such as the servo and the ESC.

Further information can be found in the [firmware specific documentation](https://me-405-w-2024.github.io/term_project/).

## Results
The system was tested in multiple stages as mechanical hardware and the respective code implementations were completed. Almost all of the mechanical hardware was 3D printed before final implementation.

Shooting for this system was moderately successful. Our biggest issues were motor power consumption, shaft misalignment, and belt tension. Shooting performance was heavily dependent on available power supplied to the shooting motor and on ball compression, which was a function of shaft alignment and shooter wheel size. Shooting was tested off of the main pivot mechanism. Due to the speed of wheel rotation, belt tension was essential to ensuring functionality. 3D printed bearing mounts and mounting plates were iterated multiple times before the final design. 

Turning the shooter with a stepper motor proved to be challenging but successful. Mechanical design was fairly simple and integration was a matter of ensuring proper belt tension. Significant design work was put into the project to minimize rotational inertia, allowing for fast stepper accelerations. The turning system was tested using a routine of a few set angles, input angles were given to the system and performance was measured. 

Unfortunately the system did not perform flawlessly in competition. Much of the failure in competition was due to relatively low-complexity thermal data processing. A simple filter was implemented to attempt to pick up only significant hot-spots in thermal data, which proved to be a flawed approach and was heavily dependent on outside factors such as more than a single individual in view of the camera. We also used a USB cable to extend the I2C bus to the thermal camera, which meant that SCL and SDA lines were twisted, introducing more noise into the system.

## Lessons Learned
Implementation of a custom shooting mechanism proved to be quite challenging indeed. Much of the hardware was iterated at least 3 separate times before being deemed successful. 

The servo-based feed mechanism was remarkably successful due to the prevalence of robust servo hardware and ease of code implementation. The rotation-to-linear motion linkage proved highly reliable. 

Shaft alignment, concentricity, and belt tension proved the most challenging aspects of mechanical design. Proper belt tension provisions must be taken and rotating components should fit as tight as possible to any shafts to prevent excess losses. 

Ultimately, system integration proved to be the biggest challenge for this project. Each of the individual mechanical subsystems proved successful independently, but integration with the final thermal camera was the downfall of performance. More time should have been put into thermal camera data processing to accurately determine the centroid of heat for proper targeting, and less time should have been spent on mechanical hardware design. It did look cool, though. 

We recommend that this project is not recreated for similar competitions without significantly more time invested into entire system performance analysis. While the turning and shooting mechanisms proved interesting to design and program, the project did not perform better than a simple Nerf gun and required significantly more overhead for design and testing to even acquire baseline functionality.
